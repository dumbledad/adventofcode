# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of Code 2022 as part of getting back into Python https://adventofcode.com/

## Notes

- Python naming conventions
  - https://github.com/naming-convention/naming-convention-guides/tree/master/python (based on
  Guido's conventions)
  - https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/399583/50096
  - https://stackoverflow.com/a/48721872/575530 (variables)

## TODO

- [ ] Write unit tests
  - [x] For utility functions
  - [x] For the main functionality in parts 1 and 2
- [ ] Have these examples and answers served by Django, VueJS, and SVG
- [ ] Dockerize
- [ ] Use a cloud VM rather than local
- [ ] Make maximum use of
  - [ ] Functional programming style built in list etc. handling (e.g. `map`)
  - [ ] NumPy
  - [ ] Pandas

## Reflections

### Day 1

- Careful about the end of inputs, does the final `add` get triggered correctly
- Pandas `nlargest` was useful and [more performant](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.nlargest.html#pandas.DataFrame.nlargest) than sorting.
- Make sure the debugger is working

### Day 3

- `@classmethod` is handy to make things testable
- Use `pytest` and write simple unit tests as I go along so I have confidence about the utility methods

### Day 4

- Other code niceties are `_private_methods` (a convention) `@property` and `from functools import cached_property`
- Good tests really sped this up, but

### Day 5

- Edge conditions not present in test data floored me repeatedly. When I refactor it's important that tests catch new errors
- Are regexes simpler/better than raw indexes?
- `[::-1]` looked cryptic, but is just the `[start:stop:step]` and reverses the list
- I needn't have kept the crate's `[` & `]`, that caused trouble printing
- A mixture of proper debugging and printing was useful, would a _to string_ function have been used in the debugger's output?

### Day 7

- Use `dirs = [] + self._sub_dirs` to avoid taking a second pointer to `self._sub_dirs`.
- I can use `if file_match := re.match('(\d+) (.*)', row)` instead of `file_match = re.match('(\d+) (.*', row)` then `if file_match:`.
- There are two edge cases that don't get exercised by the test data nor the real data. Almost everybody's solution fails the first one (mine included) and most fail the second. Should I be
basing things on the data more than the question itself?
  - `$ cd /` should take you back to the root from wherever you currently are
  - Revisiting and `ls` in the same directory twice should not double its size!

### Day 9

- Careful reading, e.g. H, 1, â€¦ 9 is 10 knots, not 9.
