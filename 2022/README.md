# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of Code 2022 as part of getting back into Python https://adventofcode.com/

## Notes

- Python naming conventions
  - https://github.com/naming-convention/naming-convention-guides/tree/master/python (based on
  Guido's conventions)
  - https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/399583/50096
  - https://stackoverflow.com/a/48721872/575530 (variables)

## TODO

- [x] Write unit tests
  - [x] For utility functions
  - [x] For the main functionality in parts 1 and 2
  - [x] Add coverage (run as, for example, `coverage run -m pytest 2022/test_day10.py`)
- [x] Git
  - [x] Move input data to private sub-repo
  - [x] Combine years into one repo
- [ ] Have these examples and answers served by Django, VueJS, and SVG
- [ ] Dockerize
- [ ] Use a cloud VM rather than local
- [ ] Make maximum use of
  - [ ] Functional programming style built in list etc. handling (e.g. `map`)
  - [ ] NumPy
  - [ ] Pandas

## Reflections

### Day 1

- Careful about the end of inputs, does the final `add` get triggered correctly
- Pandas `nlargest` was useful and [more performant](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.nlargest.html#pandas.DataFrame.nlargest) than sorting.
- Make sure the debugger is working

### Day 3

- `@classmethod` is handy to make things testable
- Use `pytest` and write simple unit tests as I go along so I have confidence about the utility methods

### Day 4

- Other code niceties are `_private_methods` (a convention) `@property` and `from functools import cached_property`
- Good tests really sped this up, but

### Day 5

- Edge conditions not present in test data floored me repeatedly. When I refactor it's important that tests catch new errors
- Are regexes simpler/better than raw indexes?
- `[::-1]` looked cryptic, but is just the `[start:stop:step]` and reverses the list
- I needn't have kept the crate's `[` & `]`, that caused trouble printing
- A mixture of proper debugging and printing was useful, would a _to string_ function have been used in the debugger's output?

### Day 7

- Use `dirs = [] + self._sub_dirs` to avoid taking a second pointer to `self._sub_dirs`.
- I can use `if file_match := re.match('(\d+) (.*)', row)` instead of `file_match = re.match('(\d+) (.*', row)` then `if file_match:`.
- There are two edge cases that don't get exercised by the test data nor the real data. Almost everybody's solution fails the first one (mine included) and most fail the second. Should I be
basing things on the data more than the question itself?
  - `$ cd /` should take you back to the root from wherever you currently are
  - Revisiting and `ls` in the same directory twice should not double its size!

### Day 9

- Careful reading, e.g. H, 1, â€¦ 9 is 10 knots, not 9.

### Day 10

- 100% coverage is satisfying
- Part 2 was not accessible for visually impaired programmers
- We should **not** be committing input files ([reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zh2hk0/2022friendly_reminder_dont_commit_your_input/)). That'll be a good excuse to look at sub-repositories
  - Took the opportunity to combine my 2021 and 2022 repositories (following [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10548919/575530) using the [allow-unrelated-histories](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#Documentation/git-merge.txt---allow-unrelated-histories)).
  - Used git's [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules#_starting_submodules) feature to move all the copied AoC inputs (test and real) to a private repository.

### Day 10

- Calling `Monkey.bored_with` picks the instance method not the class method of the same name!

### Day 11

- Part 2 was hard. The breakthrough for me was `throw['item'] %= self.product` which was a result of me realising it was mathematical (from a comment on reddit).
